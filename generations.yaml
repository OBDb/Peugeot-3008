    description: "The original Peugeot 3008 was introduced as a compact crossover with distinctive MPV influences, featuring a relatively tall body, practical interior, and innovative features. The exterior design blended elements of both SUVs and minivans with a rounded profile, distinctive Peugeot family face, and a unique split tailgate that could function as both a conventional hatch and a small pickup-style dropgate. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included gasoline engines from 1.2L to 1.6L and diesel options from 1.6L to 2.0L, with manual and automatic transmission options. A innovative diesel-electric Hybrid4 variant was introduced in 2011, featuring a 2.0L diesel engine powering the front wheels and an electric motor for the rear wheels, creating a through-the-road all-wheel drive system. The interior showcased a cockpit-like design with a high center console, aircraft-style handbrake, and a driver-oriented layout. Notable features included the Grip Control enhanced traction system offering various terrain modes without the complexity and weight of a traditional AWD system, a Head-Up Display, and an available panoramic glass roof. A significant refresh in 2013 brought updated styling with LED signature lighting, improved interior materials, and enhanced technology features. The first-generation 3008 established the model as a practical, innovative option in the growing crossover segment, with strong sales particularly in European markets where its combination of MPV practicality with crossover styling and features appealed to family buyers."

    description: "The second-generation Peugeot 3008 represented a dramatic reinvention, transforming from a MPV-crossover hybrid into a fully-fledged SUV with bold, contemporary styling. Built on PSA's new EMP2 platform, it features a more muscular stance, distinctive front end with an aggressive grille design, and numerous SUV styling cues including pronounced wheel arches and protective body cladding. Powertrain options expanded to include various PureTech gasoline engines (1.2L to 1.6L), BlueHDi diesel options (1.5L to 2.0L), and plug-in hybrid variants introduced in 2019 offering either front-wheel drive (225 hp combined) or all-wheel drive (300 hp combined) with up to 36 miles of electric-only range. The interior showcases an evolved version of Peugeot's i-Cockpit with a compact steering wheel, 12.3-inch digital instrument display, and 8-inch (later 10-inch) touchscreen, complemented by distinctive toggle switches and high-quality materials. Advanced technology includes semi-autonomous driving features, automated parking, and a comprehensive suite of driver assistance systems. A significant refresh in 2020 brought updated exterior styling with a frameless grille, redesigned lighting elements, and enhanced technology including night vision capabilities on higher trims. The second-generation 3008 achieved critical acclaim, winning European Car of the Year 2017 and numerous other awards, successfully repositioning the model as a premium-feeling offering in the highly competitive compact SUV segment and becoming one of Peugeot's global bestsellers."

    description: "The third-generation Peugeot 3008 represents another significant evolution, transforming into a fastback-SUV with a dramatically more futuristic design. Built on Stellantis's new STLA Medium platform designed specifically for electrification, it features a sleeker, more aerodynamic profile with a steeply raked rear window, distinctive front-end with Peugeot's new light signature, and more angular overall aesthetic. For the first time, the 3008 lineup includes a fully electric e-3008 variant as the flagship, offering multiple battery options (73 kWh or 98 kWh) providing ranges up to approximately 435 miles in the Long Range version. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains are also available, maintaining powertrain flexibility while shifting focus toward electrification. The interior introduces Peugeot's new Panoramic i-Cockpit featuring a curved 21-inch screen combining the instrument cluster and infotainment functions, complemented by a minimalist dashboard design with few physical controls. Advanced technology includes upgraded driver assistance systems, augmented reality navigation, and sophisticated connected services. Passenger space is enhanced despite the sleeker roofline, with a focus on premium materials and sustainable options including recycled fabrics. The third-generation 3008 positions itself as a technological showcase for Peugeot, bridging the gap between traditional SUVs and electric vehicles while maintaining the distinctive design philosophy and premium positioning established by its predecessor, targeting increasingly electrification-focused European markets with a forward-looking design and technology approach."
